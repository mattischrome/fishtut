title: 2023 Albums of the Year Preview
summary: "It might have been a good idea to write all the reviews prior to publishing this summary. You'll get ten eventually, I promise."

Another year (nearly) over and so starting from tomorrow, I'm going to count down my top 10 albums of 2023. The rules are:

1. They have to have to have been released in 2023.
2. They need to be albums. I'm defining this as either more than 7 tracks or songs, or more than forty minutes in length.
3. To make the top ten, they need to have been played the most times. I admit that I don't have a precise measure of this, as I do still buy vinyl and about four of these albums will have had play counts missed by not being captured through a streaming service.
4. Compilations are not included, whether they feature multiple artists or a retrospective of a single artist.

And that's pretty much it. Have I done any prep work? Well no, not really. I made a preliminary list at the start of October and not only was the number one album not out at the time (!) but I also had mistakenly included two albums from 2022. So yeah, this is not a pro operation. ðŸ˜‚

There have definitely been tracks I've loved that weren't on an album and there is one compilation that I've listened to enough that I should write about. So expect an honourable mentions post at some point too. Once we hit the "tweenmas" doldrums, I'll also try and put together a playlist of favourite songs from 2023 too.

So that's the meta out of the way. Join me tomorrow for album 10!
