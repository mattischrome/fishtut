White rabbits and all that. 

Even more than during the pandemic, I'm feeling these days like the days, weeks, and months are all blurring into one another. It's getting harder to figure out what year something happened, how the old the cats are, and just how overdue all my promises are. It's definitely getting harder to look at this blog and wonder whether it will ever get back to its heyday of regularly posted updates. It's possible that the continued erosion of various social media sites might make blogs useful, useable, and used again, though popularity of a medium is no guarantee that I will actually use it!

Anyway, yet another post that's a bit of a whinge about how little I post! I will try and do better on whatever day 'tomorrow' ends up being!
