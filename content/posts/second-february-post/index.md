title: A February Project
---

Hmmm it seems as though the `ffi` gem as installed by bundler is not compatible with a Mac that has an M1 chip. This limits my ability to preview blog posts locally. I might have to swap to a more modern static site generator (which is probably easier than working out what `ffi` actually does) - seems like a good February project!
