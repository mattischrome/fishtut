As with most years, I had hoped to start off 2023 with a flurry of new blog posts. Instead I caught Covid, which knocked me out for most of 'betweenmas' and put paid to my hopes for a productive start to the year. At the time of writing this post, I only just feel like I have begun to get back to 'normal', or at least as normal as things have been since 2020.

However, I do intend to start writing more posts again. I'm also hoping that they have more meat to them than the occasional autobiographical posts of the past few years. It may be that the newer posts end up on a new blog instead, but if that ends up being the case I will put some links across from on this site.
